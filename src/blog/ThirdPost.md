**The Pareto principle**

- 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
- Remember the one thing rule

**Follow the Parkinson's law**

- work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- set small time blocks for specified tasks or goals

**HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT**

**1. Make It Obvious**

1. Fill out the **Habits Scorecard**. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.
2. Use **implementation intentions**: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
3. Use **habit stacking**: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT  I NEED].”
4. **Design your environment**. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

**2. Make It Attractive**

1. Use **temptation bundling**. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.
2. **Join a culture** where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
3. **Create a motivation ritual**. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
4. “After [HABIT  I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].” (combine it with habit stacking)

**3. Make It Easy**

1. **Reduce friction**. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.
2. **Prime the environment**. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.
3. **Master the decisive moment**. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.
4. **Use the Two-Minute Rule**. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.
5. **Automate your habits**. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

**4. Make It Satisfying**

1. **Use reinforcement**. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.
2. **Make “doing nothing” enjoyable**. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.
3. **Use a habit tracker**. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”
4. **Never miss twice**. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

HOW TO **BREAK A BAD HABIT**

**1. Make It Invisible**

   **Reduce exposure**. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

**2. Make It Unattractive**

   **Reframe your mind-set**. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.

**3. Make It Difficult**

   **Increase friction**. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.

**2. Use a commitment device**. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.

   **Make It Unsatisfying**

**1. Get an accountability partner**. Ask someone to watch your behavior.

   **Create a habit contract**. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.
